      <description>i had a little brother
who was misunderstood
he would color in the corner
when things were going good
when things turned bad or he got mad
you&amp;rsquo;d better stay away
he would try real hard to be like me
but somewhere lost his way
after prison he went really bad
now he is gone for good
i miss him still</description>

      <description>staring at a blank page is uncomfortable
how to bring it to life
will it ever reach it&amp;rsquo;s potential
ideas that danced through my mind moments ago
left town in a hurry
didn&amp;rsquo;t leave a forwarding address
my mind wanders like a drunk in a dark alley
bouncing off the hard edges
maybe this page is destined for the dumpster</description>

      <description>does it really matter?
i am just one of over seven billion people living on this little blue/green planet with you. since you aren&amp;rsquo;t planning to get me a gift for my birthday&amp;hellip;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter how young/old i am. residing in america means that i am equal no matter the color of my skin&amp;hellip;so unless you are a bigot my race shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be important. chances are good that we have never slept together and probably won&amp;rsquo;t in the near future&amp;hellip;so my sex, gender, orientation and preferences aren&amp;rsquo;t really your concern.</description>
