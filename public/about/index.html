<p>i am just one of over seven billion people living on this little blue/green planet with you. since you aren&rsquo;t planning to get me a gift for my birthday&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t really matter how young/old i am. residing in america means that i am equal no matter the color of my skin&hellip;so unless you are a bigot my race shouldn&rsquo;t be important. chances are good that we have never slept together and probably won&rsquo;t in the near future&hellip;so my sex, gender, orientation and preferences aren&rsquo;t really your concern.</p>

<p>you don&rsquo;t know me and you don&rsquo;t need to know me. enjoy my work/play&hellip;or don&rsquo;t. it really makes no difference to me.</p>

<p>is it really that important to you?</p>

<p>i didn&rsquo;t think so&hellip;</p>
