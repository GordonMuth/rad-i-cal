      <description>i had a little brother
who was misunderstood
he would color in the corner
when things were going good
when things turned bad or he got mad
you&amp;rsquo;d better stay away
he would try real hard to be like me
but somewhere lost his way
after prison he went really bad
now he is gone for good
i miss him still</description>

      <description>staring at a blank page is uncomfortable
how to bring it to life
will it ever reach it&amp;rsquo;s potential
ideas that danced through my mind moments ago
left town in a hurry
didn&amp;rsquo;t leave a forwarding address
my mind wanders like a drunk in a dark alley
bouncing off the hard edges
maybe this page is destined for the dumpster</description>
