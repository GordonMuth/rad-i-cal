staring at a blank page is uncomfortable

how to bring it to life

will it ever reach it's potential

ideas that danced through my mind moments ago

left town in a hurry

didn't leave a forwarding address

my mind wanders like a drunk in a dark alley

bouncing off the hard edges

maybe this page is destined for the dumpster
