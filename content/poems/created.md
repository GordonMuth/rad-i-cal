when i consider the magic in the natural world

the complex systems take me to a place of wonder

who could have imagined the fantastic mechanics

that move our planet round the sun like clockwork

who could have imagined the diverse lifeforms

each performing biological functions flawlessly

who could have imagined the complex chemistry

that fuels all life at the cellular level

who could have imagined it all so beautifully

that witnessing nature fills me with peace

who was the architect?

who was the creator?

random chance?

accident?

something so far outside the realm of our understanding

that we find ourselves sitting here in awe of creation
