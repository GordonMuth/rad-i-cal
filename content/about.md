does it really matter?

i am just one of over seven billion people living on this little blue/green planet with you. since you aren't planning to get me a gift for my birthday...it doesn't really matter how young/old i am. residing in america means that i am equal no matter the color of my skin...so unless you are a bigot my race shouldn't be important. chances are good that we have never slept together and probably won't in the near future...so my sex, gender, orientation and preferences aren't really your concern.  

you don't know me and you don't need to know me. enjoy my work/play...or don't. it really makes no difference to me.

is it really that important to you?

i didn't think so...
